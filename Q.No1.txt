How To Compare two JSON have the Same Properties  Without Order.

     JSON.stringify(remoteJSON) == JSON.stringify(localJSON) 
     but this return false: it seems that the order of the
     properties is important.

var remoteJSON = {"allowExternalMembers": "false", 
"whoCanJoin": "CAN_REQUEST_TO_JOIN"},
    localJSON = {"whoCanJoin": "CAN_REQUEST_TO_JOIN", 
    "allowExternalMembers": "false"};
    
console.log( _.isEqual(remoteJSON, localJSON) );

And I even tried deep compare with this solution and always got a false return.
